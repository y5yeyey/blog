# blog
Hi, welcome to my blog! Feel free to access via [here](http://54.183.6.155 "Congwei's Homepage").

The whole project is pushed online at AWS. The back-end of this web service is developed under Flask (Python framework) and front-end is utilized MaterializeCSS. The goal of this blog is to show code samples as well as dynamic projects that may not able to be shown in my resume. Also, I will keep updating my resume on my site.

### A little bit about myself 
I am a first year Master student majoring in Statistics at University of California, Irvine (UCI). Before joining UCI, I have been working as a Data Engineer at CreditEase for 9-month and as a Data Analyst at BitAuto (NYSE: BITA) for 6-month, respectively. I am proficient in Python, SQL and R. I have hands-on experience on HiveQL and data steaming in scripts and I have built framework in Python for data analytics, which reduces half of the time to writing complex SQL queries.
